# Crime-data-for-the-Neo4j
Crime data for this demo was downloaded from public sources (http://data.gov.uk), and is freely provided for download with locations defined to the block or street level and crimes defined by month only (i.e. no day or timestamp). This public crime data does not include any sort of information about persons related to crimes, not even as anonymised tokens - it supplies only crime and location data, or in other words only the 'L' and 'E' for the POLE model. This demo uses street crime data for Greater Manchester, UK from August 2017.

Unique crime IDs, longitude, latitude, crime type, street/locale name, and last outcome values were taken from the public street crime data files. UK postcodes were retrieved from a public API using Longitude and Latitude, and randomly generated or curated data was used for other entities in the database (vehicles, officers, people, phone numbers, phone calls, emails, day of the month, etc.).

All scenarios and persons portrayed in this demo are fictitious. Any similarity to real persons or events is coincidental and unintentional.
